# squeezelite installer for Raspberry PI

Heavily based on: http://www.gerrelt.nl/RaspberryPi/wordpress/tutorial-installing-squeezelite-player-on-raspbian/

run `install_sqlite.sh` to get going. The program gets squeezelite (armhf) from google code, copies all files to the right place and provides a nice init script.
